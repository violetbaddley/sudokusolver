A program to solve a sudoku puzzle.

This is the main runnerfile.
It is very **strongly recommended** that you read over the usage
description (which you can get by running this program with no
puzzle provided) first.

The actual game logic is headed up in the Sudoku module.

Usage: sudokusolver.py [board.txt] [-options]
    Either "board.txt" or standard-in should contain a valid sudoku board.
    You can also optionally specify any of the following options:
      -ac3     ---  check arc consistency
      -mrv     ---  select squares by min. remaining val.
      -lcv     ---  select values by least constraining
      -stats   ---  report the number of bad placements and backtracks
        -time  ---  always show time-to-solve in -stats
      -noprog  ---  process without der blinkenlights
      -po      ---  print out original board
